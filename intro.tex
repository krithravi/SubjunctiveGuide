Hello, eager student!\\

For most readers, the subjunctive \textit{mood} (not \textit{tense}, we'll get into that) is one of the most challenging aspects of the Spanish language. \\

Why read this guide? This guide is designed for an English-speaking, Spanish-learning student. This is the condensed version of everything you'll need to know to use and understand the subjunctive mood confidently. This guide tries to clear up some common misconceptions around the spooky subjunctive and is meant for an advanced student. \\

It assumes you already know how to work with the indicative mood (which you probably already know if you're reading this). This guide covers the vast majority of what you'll need to know regarding the subjunctive.  \\

Let's dive in!
